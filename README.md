# SkinDiseaseDetectionSystem - A Deep Learning Approach

## Overview  
This project leverages AI and deep learning to create a system for detecting skin diseases. The system enables users to upload images of affected skin areas and provides a preliminary diagnosis. Its purpose is to assist in early detection, particularly in underserved regions.  

## Data Source  
The dataset used for training, validating testing the system was sourced from [DermNet](https://dermnetnz.org/images) and A-Derma Clinic in Tirana, Albania.

## Features  
- Preliminary diagnosis based on image uploads.  
- Built using DenseNet-121 for high accuracy and efficiency.  
- Augmented dataset to enhance model robustness and balance.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Python**: Main programming language.  
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, OpenCV, Tkinter, Matplotlib.
